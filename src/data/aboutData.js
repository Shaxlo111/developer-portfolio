    description2: "I am a graduate of the University of Information Technology and am currently studying Fullstack Web-Development. I did project work at the university on computer graphics. The website was not the focus of the project, but working on it was such an exciting experience that it seemed like a career in the field was right. I also love teaching. I am even happier teaching others what I know.",
